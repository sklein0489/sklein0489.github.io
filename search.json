    "title": "Why did the Killer B’s never win a Super Bowl?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most storied franchises in the NFL, with their 6 Super Bowls tying the Patriots for the most in the league. In recent years, however, the Steelers have taken a notable downturn. Their last Super Bowl win was in 2008, their last Super Bowl appearance was in 2010, and their last playoff win was in 2016. In Pittsburgh, the standard is Super Bowls, and the organization simply isn’t maintaining that standard.\nThis isn’t to stay that the Steelers haven’t had their chances. Since their last Super Bowl appearance in 2010, the Steelers have reached the playoffs in 9 out of 14 years. The Steelers won the competitive AFC North in 4 of those years, with 3 titles from 2013-2017.\nThis period is crucial. In the NFL - or any professional sports league for that matter - championship windows come and go quickly. An organization needs to recognize when they have a team capable of winning it all so that they can go all-in to ensure the team accomplishes its goal.\nSo what was so different about these 5 years?\nEnter “The Killer B’s”, the extremely potent offensive trio of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, running back Le’Veon Bell, and wide receiver Antonio Brown.\nWhen this trio took the field, they were borderline unstoppable, and their accolades proved it. From 2013-2017, Roethlisberger, Bell, and Brown earned a combined 6 first-team All-Pro selections - for reference, the highly-regarded Cowboys’ “Triplets” earned a combined 5 first-team All-Pro selections in 10 seasons. The Killer B’s weren’t just insanely good - they were historically good.\nNeedless to say, The Killer B’s were head and shoulders above the rest in yards from 2013-2017.\n\n\nCode\nnfl_player_box &lt;- load_player_stats(seasons = 1999:2024, stat_type = \"offense\")\n\nyears &lt;- c(2013:2017)\ntrio &lt;- c(\"QB\", \"RB\", \"WR\")\n\nnfl_trio &lt;- nfl_player_box |&gt;\n  filter(position %in% trio, season %in% years) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(weeks_per_season = max(week),\n         game = row_number()) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\neligible &lt;- nfl_trio |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(eligible = max(game)) |&gt;\n  filter(eligible &gt;= 50)\n\nnfl_trio &lt;- nfl_trio |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% eligible$player_display_name)\n\nnfl_qb &lt;- nfl_trio |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  select(player_display_name, position, recent_team, season, week, passing_yards, game) |&gt;\n  mutate(cum_passing = cumsum(passing_yards)) |&gt;\n  filter(position == \"QB\")\n\nnfl_rb &lt;- nfl_trio |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  select(player_display_name, position, recent_team, season, week, \n         rushing_yards, receiving_yards, game) |&gt;\n  mutate(all_purpose = rushing_yards + receiving_yards,\n         cum_all_purpose = cumsum(all_purpose)) |&gt;\n  filter(position == \"RB\")\n\nnfl_wr &lt;- nfl_trio |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  select(player_display_name, position, recent_team, season, week, \n         rushing_yards, receiving_yards, game) |&gt;\n  mutate(all_purpose = rushing_yards + receiving_yards,\n         cum_all_purpose = cumsum(all_purpose)) |&gt;\n  filter(position == \"WR\")\n\nbig_ben &lt;- nfl_qb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Ben Roethlisberger\")\n\nbrees &lt;- nfl_qb|&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Drew Brees\")\n\nbrady &lt;- nfl_qb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Tom Brady\")\n\nryan &lt;- nfl_qb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Matt Ryan\")\n\nbell &lt;- nfl_rb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Le'Veon Bell\")\n\nmccoy &lt;- nfl_rb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"LeSean McCoy\")\n\nmurray &lt;- nfl_rb |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"DeMarco Murray\")\n\nab &lt;- nfl_wr |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Antonio Brown\")\n\njones &lt;- nfl_wr |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Julio Jones\")\n\nthomas &lt;- nfl_wr |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Demaryius Thomas\")\n\nbig_ben &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_step(\n    data = nfl_qb,\n    aes(x = game, y = cum_passing, group = player_display_name),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_step(\n    data = big_ben,\n    aes(x = game, y = cum_passing, group = player_display_name),\n    color = \"#FFB612\"\n  ) +\n  geom_step(\n    data = brees,\n    aes(x = game, y = cum_passing, group = player_display_name),\n    color = \"#D3BC8D\"\n  ) +\n  geom_step(\n    data = brady,\n    aes(x = game, y = cum_passing, group = player_display_name),\n    color = \"#002244\"\n  ) +\n  geom_step(\n    data = ryan,\n    aes(x = game, y = cum_passing, group = player_display_name),\n    color = \"#A71930\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = max(big_ben$game) -

a team needs more than a couple of superstars to carry them over the hump and, importantly, there’s still a whole other phase of the game to consider.\nThe Steelers defense from 2013-2017 wasn’t as flashy. In the same span that The Killer B’s had 6 combined first-team All-Pro selections, the Steelers’ defense had ONE: Cameron Heyward in 2017. Surely, this lack of production on the defensive side would hold them back, right?\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(69)\n\nteam_stats &lt;- calculate_stats(\n  seasons = 2013:2017,\n  summary_level = \"week\",\n  stat_type = \"team\",\n  season_type = \"REG+POST\")\n\nteam_box &lt;- team_stats |&gt;\n  mutate(team_score = \n           passing_tds*6 + rushing_tds*6 + special_teams_tds*6 + def_tds*6 + fumble_recovery_tds*6 +\n           fg_made*3 + pat_made + def_safeties*2 + \n           passing_2pt_conversions*2 + rushing_2pt_conversions*2,\n         new_passing_yards = passing_yards+sack_yards_lost,\n         total_yards = new_passing_yards+rushing_yards)\n\n#write_csv(team_box, \"data/team_box_nfl.csv\")\n\nteam_box &lt;- read.csv(\"data/team_box_nfl.csv\")\n\nteam_summary &lt;- team_box |&gt;\n  group_by(team) |&gt;\n  summarise(offppg = mean(team_score),\n            defppg = mean(opponent_score),\n            wins = sum(result == \"W\"))\n\nsteelers &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"PIT\")\n\nravens &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"BAL\")\n\nbengals &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"CIN\")\n\nbrowns &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"CLE\")\n\npatriots &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"NE\")\n\nteams &lt;- c(\"PIT\", \"BAL\", \"CLE\", \"CIN\", \"NE\")\n\nlegend_teams &lt;- team_summary |&gt;\n  filter(!team %in% teams)\n\nmean_offppg &lt;- mean(team_summary$offppg)\nmean_defppg &lt;- mean(team_summary$defppg)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = team_summary,\n    aes(\n      x = offppg,\n      y = defppg,\n      size = wins\n    ),\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = .3\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ravens,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg, size = wins),\n    color = \"#241773\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = bengals,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg, size = wins),\n    color = \"#FB4F14\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = browns,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg, size = wins),\n    color = \"#311D00\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = patriots,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg, size = wins),\n    color = \"#002244\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = steelers,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg, size = wins),\n    color = \"#FFB612\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = steelers,\n    aes(x = offppg - .3, y = defppg + .3, label = team),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = ravens,\n    aes(x = offppg + .3, y = defppg + .25, label = team),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = bengals,\n    aes(x = offppg - .1, y = defppg - .3, label = team),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = browns,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg - .2, label = team),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = patriots,\n    aes(x = offppg, y = defppg + .4, label = team),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(x = 27.5, y = 21, label = \"Good Offense, Good Defense\", size = 25),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(x = 25, y = 25.5, label = \"Good Offense, Bad Defense\", size = 25),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(x = 20, y = 20, label = \"Bad Offense, Good Defense\", size = 25),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(x = 18.5, y = 24.25, label = \"Bad Offense, Bad Defense\", size = 25),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_offppg) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_defppg) +\n  scale_size(range = c(1, 10), name = \"Wins\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offensive Points/Game\",\n    y = \"Defensive Points/Game\",\n    title = \"The Steelers' offense and defense were strongly above the league average\",\n    subtitle = \"While not at the top of the league, Pittsburgh firmly established itself as a perennial playoff team from 2013-2017\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the defense… wasn’t the issue. Although the Steelers’ divisional foes - other than the abysmal Browns - held their opponents to fewer points per game, the Steelers’ offensive output more than compensated, and their defense still performed above the average.\nNotably, the Patriots posted the best offense and third-best defense in this span. Perhaps the Steelers’ lack of success could be chalked up to competing against a dynasty.\nThere is a slight problem with this theory - the Steelers only met the Patriots ONCE during the postseason from 2013-2017, where they were thoroughly demolished in the 2016 AFC Championship game.\nSo, if the Steelers didn’t run into the buzzsaw that was the Patriots, then what’s up with the lack of Super Bowl appearances and titles?\nScheming and game-planning can only take you so far. At some point, teams need talent to elevate them to new heights, and it quickly became clear that the Steelers just didn’t have enough talent on defense.\nThe Steelers played 7 postseason games from 2013-2017 and, unfortunately, their defense didn’t show up like it had in the regular season for many of those games.\n\n\nCode\nreg_post &lt;- team_box |&gt;\n  group_by(team, season_type) |&gt;\n  summarise(offppg = mean(team_score),\n            defppg = mean(opponent_score)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = season_type, values_from = c(offppg, defppg))\n  \npostseason &lt;- reg_post |&gt;\n  filter(offppg_POST != is.na(offppg_POST),\n         defppg_POST != is.na(defppg_POST)) |&gt;\n  arrange(defppg_REG)\n\nmean_defppg_REG &lt;- mean(postseason$defppg_REG)\nmean_defppg_POST &lt;- mean(postseason$defppg_POST)\n\noverachieved &lt;- postseason |&gt;\n  filter(defppg_POST &lt; defppg_REG)\n\nsteelers &lt;- postseason |&gt;\n  filter(team == \"PIT\")\n  \nggplot(postseason, aes(y = reorder(team, defppg_REG, decreasing = TRUE))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(yend = team, x = defppg_POST, xend = defppg_REG), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_segment(data = overachieved, aes(, yend = team, x = defppg_POST, xend = defppg_REG), color = \"green\") +\n  geom_segment(data = steelers, aes(, yend = team, x = defppg_POST, xend = defppg_REG), color = \"red\", size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(data = postseason, aes(x = defppg_POST), color = \"gold\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_point(data = postseason, aes(x = defppg_REG), color = \"black\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_point(data = steelers, aes(x = defppg_REG), color = \"black\", size = 5) +\n  geom_point(data = steelers, aes(x = defppg_POST), color = \"gold\", size = 5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_defppg_REG, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_defppg_POST, color = \"gold\") +\n  geom_text(data = NULL, aes(x = 27, y = \"KC\", label = \"Postseason Average\")) +\n  geom_text(data = NULL, aes(x = 19.5, y = \"NO\", label = \"Regular Season Average\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Defensive Points/Game\",\n    y = \"Team\",\n    title = \"The Steelers' defense performed worse in the playoffs\",\n    subtitle = \"Their opponents scored around 4 PPG more in the &lt;span style='color:gold;'&gt;**postseason**&lt;/span&gt; than the &lt;span style='color:black'&gt;**regular season**&lt;/span&gt; from 2013-2017\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour points are critical in playoff games, where many come down to game-winning field goals or last-second miracle plays. The Steelers’ defense that performed above the regular season average for points per game fell below the postseason average.\nThe most egregious instance of the defense underperforming was in the 2017 playoffs, where the hosting Steelers allowed a Blake Bortles-led Jaguars team to score 45 points in a massive upset.\nIt wasn’t known at the time, but this game marked the end of the Killer B’s era. Bell held out in 2018 before signing with the Jets in 2019, while Brown played one more season in Pittsburgh before also forcing his way out in 2019. Bell and Brown’s departures left an aging Roethlisberger in control of a severely depleted offense, and the Steelers’ Super Bowl window was effectively closed.\nThe years since haven’t been kind to the Steelers, who are still searching for their first playoff win in the post-Killer B’s era. As the decade mark approaches, fans are left wondering if the Steelers will remain an NFL staple or if they will slip ever further into mediocrity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Aaron Rodgers is considered one of the most talented quarterbacks ever to suit up in the NFL. After initially sliding to the 24th pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, Rodgers quickly made teams regret passing him up, as he would go on to win 4 MVPs in his career and a Super Bowl MVP in 2010. In addition, Rodgers practically ran the NFC North, winning the division in half of the years he played in Green Bay.\nHere are the 15 quarterbacks with the most touchdowns in the NFL since 1999. You’ll notice that Rodgers is 4th on that list, creeping up on Peyton Manning.\n\n\nCode\nqb_player_box &lt;- load_player_stats(seasons = 1999:2024, stat_type = \"offense\") |&gt;\n  filter(position == \"QB\")\n  \ntop_15 &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_tds = sum(passing_tds)) |&gt;\n  top_n(15, passing_tds) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(passing_tds))\n\nqb_tds &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_tds = sum(passing_tds)) |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% top_15$player_display_name)\n\nrodgers &lt;- qb_tds |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\nactive_players &lt;- c(\"Matthew Stafford\", \n                    \"Russell Wilson\", \n                    \"Kirk Cousins\", \n                    \"Patrick Mahomes\", \n                    \"Joe Flacco\",\n                    \"Derek Carr\", \n                    \"Andy Dalton\")\n\nactive_qbs &lt;- qb_tds |&gt;\n  filter(qb_tds$player_display_name %in% active_players)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = qb_tds,\n    aes(\n      x = reorder(player_display_name, passing_tds),\n      weight = passing_tds\n      ),\n    fill = \"#f2f2f2\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = rodgers,\n    aes(\n      x = player_display_name,\n      weight = passing_tds\n      ),\n    fill = \"#FFB612\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = active_qbs,\n    aes(\n      x = player_display_name,\n      weight = passing_tds\n      ),\n    fill = \"#d3d3d3\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Total Passing TDs Since 1999\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Rodgers is among the best scorers in NFL history\",\n    subtitle = \"Rodgers has the most touchdowns of all current players by far\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately - or fortunately for the Bears - nothing lasts forever. After his latest MVP in 2021, it felt as though the Packers were at an impasse. The then 38-year-old Rodgers had failed to bring the franchise a Super Bowl in over a decade, and the team was consistently bounced late in the playoffs.\nIt was speculated that Rodgers may retire or ask to be traded to another team, but Rodgers decided to return to the Packers for his 18th season. The decision wouldn’t prove fruitful, as the Packers failed to make the playoffs after losing to the rival Lions in Week 18.\nThat offseason, Rodgers requested a trade and ended up on the New York Jets, a franchise starved for a competent quarterback and their first playoff win since the 2010 season. For the first time in years, the Jets had legitimate hope going into the 2023 season, and it felt as though Rodgers’ career could be revived.\nThose hopes were quickly dashed in the Jets’ Week 1 game against the Bills. Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles tear just four plays into the season, and the Jets were back to square one.\nUnsurprisingly, the Jets missed the playoffs, looking forward to Rodgers’ return in 2024. The anticipation was misguided, however, as Rodgers struggled to muster wins upon returning, ultimately leading to another playoff absence.\nIn his short time with the Jets, it became apparent that Rodgers was not who he once was. Now in the twilight of his career, Rogers is contemplating retirement while keeping several quarterback-needy teams on the hook.\nSo, is it time for Rodgers to hang it up?\nThat question is… complicated. Although Rodgers is no longer the player he used to be, some believe he is still a capable starter, while others wonder if Rodgers still brings value to a team.\nOne of the best measures of usefulness is ball security. If a quarterback isn’t turning the ball over, he isn’t likely hurting his team’s chances of winning.\nRodgers is a gunslinger - he’s going to throw a lot of touchdowns, but that usually means he will also throw a lot of interceptions. Is he still protecting the ball like he did earlier in his career? Let’s check him against the top 30 quarterbacks in passing touchdowns both in the last 3 seasons and in the previous 22 seasons.\n\n\nCode\npalmer &lt;- \"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/4459.png&w=350&h=254\"\nromo &lt;- \"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/5209.png&w=350&h=254\"\ncutler &lt;- \"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/9597.png&w=350&h=254\"\nfavre &lt;- \"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/112.png&w=350&h=254\"\n\nqb_first_n &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  filter(season %in% 2005:2021) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_tds = sum(passing_tds),\n            interceptions = sum(interceptions),\n            games = n(),\n            headshot = last(headshot_url))\n\ntop_30 &lt;- qb_first_n |&gt;\n  top_n(30, passing_tds)\n\nqb_first_n &lt;- qb_first_n |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% top_30$player_display_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(passing_tds))\n\nqb_first_n$headshot[11] &lt;- palmer\nqb_first_n$headshot[12] &lt;- romo\nqb_first_n$headshot[14] &lt;- cutler\nqb_first_n$headshot[26] &lt;- favre\n\nrodgers_first_n &lt;- qb_first_n |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\nqb_last_3 &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  filter(season %in% 2022:2024) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_tds = sum(passing_tds),\n            interceptions = sum(interceptions),\n            games = n(),\n            headshot = last(headshot_url))\n\ntop_30 &lt;- qb_last_3 |&gt;\n  top_n(30, passing_tds)\n\nqb_last_3 &lt;- qb_last_3 |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% top_30$player_display_name) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(passing_tds))\n\nrodgers_last_3 &lt;- qb_last_3 |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data = qb_first_n,\n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions\n    ),\n    method = lm, \n    se = FALSE,\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  geom_image(\n    data = qb_first_n,\n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions, \n      image = headshot\n    ),\n    size = .15\n  ) +\n  geom_encircle(\n    data = rodgers_first_n, \n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions\n    ), \n    s_shape = 0, \n    expand = 0, \n    color = \"#dc3545\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(\n      x = 500, \n      y = 75, \n      label = \"Fewer Interceptions than Predicted\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(\n      x = 205, \n      y = 220, \n      label = \"More Interceptions than Predicted\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Passing TDs (1999-2021)\",\n    y = \"Interceptions (1999-2021)\",\n    title = \"Despite being a gunslinger, Rodgers protected the ball\",\n    subtitle = \"He threw fewer interceptions relative to touchdowns compared to the rest of the league\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data = qb_last_3,\n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions\n    ),\n    method = lm, \n    se = FALSE,\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  geom_image(\n    data = qb_last_3,\n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions, \n      image = headshot\n    ),\n    size = .15\n  ) +\n  geom_encircle(\n    data = rodgers_last_3, \n    aes(\n      x = passing_tds, \n      y = interceptions\n    ), \n    s_shape = 0, \n    expand = 0, \n    color = \"#dc3545\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(\n      x = 70, \n      y = 15, \n      label = \"Fewer Interceptions than Predicted\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = NULL, \n    aes(\n      x = 50, \n      y = 38, \n      label = \"More Interceptions than Predicted\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"In recent years, Rodgers has regressed to the mean\",\n    subtitle = \"He now sits near the trendline and is no longer the gunslinger he used to be\",\n    x = \"Passing TDs (2022-2024)\",\n    y = \"Interceptions (2022-2024)\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts clear that Rodgers isn’t world-beating anymore, but he’s still throwing fewer interceptions than the regression line would predict. Unfortunately for Rodgers, this information alone doesn’t paint the whole picture.\nIn sports, its all about efficiency. NFL teams are constantly filling holes in their roster, replacing players that aren’t as efficient as other available players. This is most evident in the NFL Draft, where a team can CHEAPLY replace faltering starters on their team.\nAs a quarterback, efficiency is measured using metrics like yards per attempt or completion percentage. We’ll investigate the former.\n\n\nCode\ntop_15 &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  filter(max(season) != 2024) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_yards = sum(passing_yards)) |&gt;\n  top_n(14, passing_yards)\n\nrodgers &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\") |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_yards = sum(passing_yards))\n\ntop_15 &lt;- rbind(top_15, rodgers) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(passing_yards))\n  \ntop_passers &lt;- qb_player_box |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% top_15$player_display_name)\n\nqb_split_stats &lt;- top_passers |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name, season) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_yards = sum(passing_yards),\n            attempts = sum(attempts),\n            games = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(player_display_name, desc(season)) |&gt;\n  mutate(season_rank = row_number(),\n         tag = if_else(season_rank &lt;= 3, \"last_3\", \"first_n\")) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = tag, values_from = c(passing_yards, attempts, games)) |&gt;\n  select(player_display_name, passing_yards_last_3, passing_yards_first_n, attempts_last_3, attempts_first_n, games_last_3, games_first_n) |&gt;\n  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(passing_yards_last_3 = sum(passing_yards_last_3),\n         passing_yards_first_n = sum(passing_yards_first_n),\n         attempts_last_3 = sum(attempts_last_3),\n         attempts_first_n = sum(attempts_first_n),\n         games_last_3 = sum(games_last_3),\n         games_first_n = sum(games_first_n)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(ypa_last_3 = passing_yards_last_3/attempts_last_3,\n         ypa_first_n = passing_yards_first_n/attempts_first_n\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(player_display_name, ypa_last_3, ypa_first_n)\n\nrodgers &lt;- qb_split_stats |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\noverachieved &lt;- qb_split_stats |&gt;\n  filter(ypa_first_n &lt; ypa_last_3)\n\nggplot(qb_split_stats, aes(y = reorder(player_display_name, ypa_first_n, decreasing = FALSE))) +\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(\n      yend = player_display_name, \n      x = ypa_first_n, xend = ypa_last_3\n      ), \n    color = \"#dc3545\"\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = overachieved, \n    aes(\n      yend = player_display_name, \n      x = ypa_first_n, \n      xend = ypa_last_3\n      ), \n    color = \"#28a745\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = qb_split_stats, \n    aes(\n      x = ypa_first_n\n      ), \n    color = \"black\", \n    size = 2.5\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = qb_split_stats, \n    aes(\n      x = ypa_last_3\n      ), \n    color = \"gold\", \n    size = 2.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = rodgers,\n    aes(\n      label = round(rodgers$ypa_last_3, 2),\n      x = ypa_last_3 - .1,\n      y = \"Aaron Rodgers\",\n      fontface = \"bold\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = rodgers,\n    aes(\n      label = round(rodgers$ypa_first_n, 2),\n      x = ypa_first_n + .1,\n      y = \"Aaron Rodgers\",\n      fontface = \"bold\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Passing Yards/Attempt\",\n    y = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Rodgers' efficiency has dropped on par with the greats\",\n    subtitle = \"In his &lt;span style='color:gold;'&gt;**last 3 seasons**&lt;/span&gt;, Rodgers has thrown for over a yard &lt;span style='color:#dc3545;'&gt;**less**&lt;/span&gt; per attempt than in &lt;span style='color:black;'&gt;**all previous seasons**&lt;/span&gt; since 1999\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflverse | By Sam Klein\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly there’s been some regression here, but we’re comparing Rodgers to the greats.

At his peak, Rodgers was throwing for nearly 9 yards per attempt, but in 2024 he sits below the league average at less than 7 yards per attempt.\nSo, in addition to protecting the ball at a worse rate, Rodgers is less efficient at moving the ball than the league average. This will likely not bode well for teams who are looking for someone to simply come in and “game manage”.\nDoes this mean it’s time for Rodgers to retire? At this juncture, it seems as though Rodgers is on a steep slope that will only continue to plummet, so he may want to go out on his own terms before the NFL forces his hand. At the same time, there are quarterback-needy teams - like my Steelers - with quarterbacks who aren’t producing even to the level of 2024 Rodgers.\nI’m inclined to tell the man to retire. The NFL is a business - if Rodgers doesn’t make the decision for himself, one day it will be made for him. And, as evidenced by the graphs, that day is approaching.\nTime will tell if Rodgers will be back for year 21."
